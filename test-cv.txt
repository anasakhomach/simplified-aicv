Your data is screaming at you - but are you listening? I am.
While others see chaotic datasets, I see treasure hunts. I clean and validate databases like Marie Kondo, visualize so compellingly that stakeholders say "Show me that again\!", create amazingly accurate predictive models, and uncover hidden insights in your spreadsheets. No ten years of experience? True. But I am relentlessly curious and recognize patterns that others miss.
Ready to stop guessing and start knowing?
